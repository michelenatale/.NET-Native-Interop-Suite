# InteropShowcase & SidecarModel

A comprehensive demonstration of high‑performance .NET ↔ Native interoperability using:

- Shared memory ring buffers  
- Reverse P/Invoke  
- Unmanaged function pointers (V‑Tables)  
- Lock‑free cross‑process communication  
- A fully functional Sidecar worker model  

This repository contains two major components:

1. **InteropShowcase** — foundational interop examples (callbacks, V‑Tables, ring buffers)  
2. **SidecarModel** — a production‑grade architecture for hosting a native worker thread (“Sidecar”) communicating with .NET via shared memory and reverse callbacks.

## 🚀 Features

- Zero‑copy shared memory IPC  
- Lock‑free ring buffer implementation  
- Native → Managed callbacks via V‑Tables  
- Managed → Native commands via shared memory  
- Sidecar worker lifecycle (Init → Loop → Dispose)  
- Clean separation of responsibilities  
- Fully documented C# and C++ code

## 🧩 Purpose

This project is designed as a learning and reference resource for developers who want to understand:

- How to build high‑performance interop layers  
- How to design safe and efficient cross‑process communication  
- How to structure a Sidecar‑style architecture in .NET  

Enjoy exploring the internals — everything is documented and intentionally transparent.
