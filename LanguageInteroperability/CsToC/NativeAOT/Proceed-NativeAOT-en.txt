The ‘NativeLibrary’ project (see file
“Proceed-NativeLibrary.txt”) was created beforehand and the file
‘add_aot.c’ has been written in “C.”

An “add_aot.dll” must be created, which requires
two files: ‘NativeLibrary.lib’ and 'add_aot.c.'

*******************************************************

To build the “add_aot.c” file, proceed as follows.

Ensure that the platform is “x64.”

Open the command prompt, but it must be the x64 native one.
>> Go to the Windows Start menu and enter “x64 Native Tools,” then the correct one should appear.

Set the path to where add_aot.c and NativeLibrary.lib are located.
You may need to copy ‘add_aot.c’ there.
>> Change drive to X:
>> cd X:\[..]\NetLanguageInteroperability\NativeLibrary\bin\x64\Release\net10.0\win-x64\native

If necessary, use “dumpbin /headers NativeLibrary.dll | findstr machine” 
>> to check what kind of “build” it is.

Command as follows, “add_aot.dll” is created.
cl /LD add_aot.c NativeLibrary.lib /Fe:add_aot.dll

See also TestLanguageInteroperability >> Properties >> “PreBuildEvent”
See also TestLanguageInteroperability >> Properties >> “PostBuildEvent”
Copy ‘NativeLibrary.dll’ and ‘add_aot.dll’ to the following directory
x:\[..]\NetLanguageInteroperability\TestLanguageInteroperability\bin\x64\Debug\net10.0\CsToC\NativeAOT
>> !!!! both files, because add_aot.dll accesses NativeLibrary.dll afterwards !!!!!


With “dumpbin /headers add_aot.dll | findstr machine” 
>> you can check what kind of “build” it is.
