To build the “crandom.c” file, proceed as follows.

Ensure that the platform is “x64.”

Open Command Prompt, but it must be the x64 native version.
>> Go to the Windows Start menu and enter “x64 Native Tools,” then the correct one should appear.

Once “x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2026” has started, set the path to crandom.c with cd..
>> Change drive to X:
>> cd X:\[..]\NetLanguageInteroperability\LanguageInteroperability\CsToC\LibraryImport

With “dumpbin /headers crandom.dll | findstr machine” 
>> you can check what kind of “command prompt” it is.

With “cl /LD crandom.c /Fe:crandom.dll”
>> crandom.c is compiled and a crandom.dll is generated.

When asked what kind of build crandom.c is, the only answer is that the cl command does not recognize “release” in the same way as VS2026. 
However, it is already a quasi-optimized build, and therefore it can be said that it is a release-like build.

Sofern wirklich eine VS2026-Realease-Build verlangt wird kann auch der Befehl
"cl /LD /O2 /GL /Gy /DNDEBUG cadd.c /Fe:cadd.dll"
verwendet werden, Das entspricht ziemlich genau einem Visual‑Studio‑Release‑Build.

If a VS2026 release build is really required, the command
“cl /LD /O2 /GL /Gy /DNDEBUG crandom.c /Fe:crandom.dll”
can be used. This corresponds pretty closely to a Visual Studio release build.

There is a command “cl /LD /O2 crandom.c /Fe:crandom.dll” that would optimize even further, but in most cases it is not necessary, and it is not wrong to use it either.
>> /O2 = maximum optimization (corresponds roughly to release)

For a debug-like build 
“cl /LD /Zi /Od crandom.c /Fe:crandom.dll”
is not actually necessary, but it is also not wrong.
